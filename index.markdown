I started making games when I was 15 using YoYo Game's [GameMaker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/es/gamemaker) (1.4 at the time). I have keen interest in game physics, motion capture and simulation.

I am currently doing freelance work for '[Psycasso: A Disturbingly Creative Adventure](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/psycasso)'
where I develop experimental gameplay features for the core game, and helping with architecting game systems, mentoring and maintaining documentation.

I tend to be hacking at some coding project to widen my knowledge, and I am currently working on Godot engine to build a VR game using both GDNative C++ and GDScript.

I've made some homebrew games for [Wii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IwZnQj_zqE&ab_channel=JavierDieguez) / 
[Gba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBaU7Xpso-Q&ab_channel=JavierDieguez) using [devKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) 's toolchain, and written some

on them.

Outside computers, dance has been a long time favored activity of mine, and it guides my interest in mocap technologies and analyzing realistic motion.  

I like playing the drums which I do sporadically. I love understanding the fun in 'experimental' games like 'ABZU', 'The Witness', 'Manifold Garden',.. Im also into VR gaming since I've recently got a Quest 2. I dont watch many TV shows but I've been an avid The Walking Dead fan for a while now :)

That should be most of it! Find my contact / social links below, and feel free to have a look at my posts.
