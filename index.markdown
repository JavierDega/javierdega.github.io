Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a developer with an emphasis in game technology.  
Here you'll find relevant info about my work, as well as my hobbies and interests.

I started making games when I was 15 using YoYo Game's [GameMaker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/es/gamemaker) (1.4 at the time). I have keen interest in game physics, motion capture and simulation.

I am currently working on '[Psycasso: A Disturbingly Creative Adventure](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/psycasso)' with [omni-digital technologies](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/psycasso), where I develop experimental gameplay features for the core game, and help with architecting game systems, mentoring and maintaining documentation.

I tend to be hacking at something to learn, like a [2D FOSS physics solver](https://github.com/JavierDega/PiP); currently I like to play with Godot engine to build VR stuff using both GDNative C++ and GDScript, testing it on my Quest 2. I use Microsoft's Kinect SDK along with 2 Kinect V2s to record mocap and put it in Godot.

I've made some homebrew games for [Wii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IwZnQj_zqE&ab_channel=JavierDieguez) / 
[Gba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBaU7Xpso-Q&ab_channel=JavierDieguez) using [devKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) 's toolchain, and written some

on them.  

Outside computers, dance has been a long time favored activity of mine, it guides my interest in mocap technologies and analyzing realistic human motion. I like playing the drums sporadically. I love understanding the fun in 'experimental' games like ABZU, The Witness, Manifold Garden,.. and the new ways of interacting with games through VR with my Quest 2.  
I dont watch many TV shows but I've been an avid The Walking Dead fan for a while :)

That should be most of it about me!
