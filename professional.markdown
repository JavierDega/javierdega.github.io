## Freelance (April 2021 - Present)

I have done freelance development work since april 2021, taking part in different projects, from full stack web work to gamedev both in Unity and Unreal Engine.

### [Omni Digital technologies](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/)

Ollie Plaatsman, founder of omni-digital technologies, has been a friend of mine since university, and we have collaborated on numerous little games as a hobby (for example, hes made the music for my homebrew wii game!); As time went on, we started collaborating on more fully fledged games.

### [Psycasso](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/psycasso)

I'm one of the lead coders in 'Psycasso: A Disturbinly Creative Adventure'

#### [Awaken Alone](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/awakenalone)

Point & click adventure game in the style of old classics like 'Thimbleweed Park'. Wake up as the sole survivor of a space ship and piece together what happened by solving puzzles and interacting, wrangling together various items.

<br/>

As an assisting coder, I helped implementing the common item interactions (Use, pick up, drop, combine) in blueprint code and filling in the tooltip text for the hundreds of items in the spec.

<br/>

Awaken Alone is out as a prototype on [itch.io](https://omni-digital.itch.io/awakenalone) and Google Play Store. 

## [Climax Studios](https://www.climaxstudios.com/) (May 2019 - April 2021) - Coder
I have taken part in several small scale codevelopment teams, contributing
to AAA projects.  
I started writing multiplayer code for [Returnal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90njPwI8xNs), accomodating
various features for a networked environment (May 2019 - June 2020).

<br/>
I was then moved to help [Destruction All Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNO1k5NCDOk&ab_channel=PlayStation)
achieve a standard of accessibility features expected on Sony's platform (July 2020 - October 2020).

<br/>
Then I came back on Returnal to bring in those same accessibility standards before launch (October 2020 - April 2021), making the game more approachable for all audiences.
