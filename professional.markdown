## Freelance (April 2021 - Present)

I have taken freelance dev work since april 2021, taking part in different projects, from full stack web work to gamedev both in Unity and Unreal Engine.

### [Talentum Digital](https://talentumdigital.com/) - [Ku Cycle](https://www.ku-cycle.com/) Site (July - October 2021) - Full Stack Developer

Talentum is an online marketing agency based in Madrid. They contracted me as a full stack developer to finish the online shop for one of their clients, Netherlands based triathlon bikes seller [KuCycle](https://www.ku-cycle.com/), in a team of 2 devs.  
We used wordpress along with many inherited plugins, namely WooCommerce for store integration. This entailed php code for backend and queries on a mySQL database, along with html5 and javascript for frontend layout and visual logic (accordions, dropdowns, ..), following the [wordpress template architecture](https://wphierarchy.com/).

### [Omni Digital technologies](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/) - Game Developer

Ollie Plaatsman, founder of omni-digital technologies, has been a friend of mine since university, and we have collaborated on numerous little games as a hobby (for example, hes made the music for my [homebrew wii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IwZnQj_zqE) game!); As time went on, we started collaborating on more fully fledged games.

#### [Psycasso](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/psycasso) (April 2021 - Present)

<br/>
I'm one of the lead coders in 'Psycasso: A Disturbingly Creative Adventure', working on experimental gameplay elements of the core project. As a team lead, I wrote the architecture for key game systems and maintain its documentation; I consult with other devs to make sure these systems interact correctly and the development workflow remains fluid, as well as mentor when someone needs to take up tasks in a different area.  
We work in Unity.

#### [Awaken Alone](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/awakenalone) (September - October 2020)

Retro styled point & click adventure game like Thimbleweed Park, Maniac Mansion,... Made in UE4.

As an assisting coder, I came in to help implement common item interactions (Look, pick up, use, open, combine,..) in blueprint code and fill in the interaction dialogue for the hundreds of items in the spec.

<br/>

Wake up as the sole survivor of "Artemis Agroterra III" and piece together what happened by solving puzzles, interacting and wrangling together various items.

<br/>

Awaken Alone is out as a prototype on [itch.io](https://omni-digital.itch.io/awakenalone), we're currently fixing the previous Android version after an API update made it break Google Play Store's TRCs. 

## [Climax Studios](https://www.climaxstudios.com/) (May 2019 - April 2021) - Coder

I have taken part in several small scale codevelopment teams, contributing to AAA projects.
I started writing multiplayer code for [Returnal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90njPwI8xNs), accomodating gameplay features for a networked environment (May 2019 - June 2020).

<br/>

I was then moved to help [Destruction All Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNO1k5NCDOk&ab_channel=PlayStation)
achieve a standard of accessibility features expected on Sony's platform (July 2020 - October 2020).

<br/>

Then I came back on Returnal to bring in those same accessibility standards before launch (October 2020 - April 2021), making the game more approachable for all audiences.
