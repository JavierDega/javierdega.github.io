## Freelance (April 2021 - Present)

I have taken some freelance contracts since april 2021, doing game dev and full stack web work.

### [Talentum Digital](https://talentumdigital.com/) - [Ku Cycle](https://www.ku-cycle.com/) Site (July - October 2021) - Full Stack Developer

Talentum is an online marketing agency based in Madrid. They contracted me as a full stack developer to finish the online shop for one of their clients, Netherlands based triathlon bikes seller [KuCycle](https://www.ku-cycle.com/), in a team of 2 devs.  
We used wordpress along with many inherited plugins, namely WooCommerce for store integration. This entailed php code for backend and queries on a mySQL database, along with html5 and javascript for frontend layout and visual logic (accordions, dropdowns, ..), following the [wordpress template architecture](https://wphierarchy.com/).

### [Omni Digital technologies](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/) - [Psycasso](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/psycasso) (April 2021 - Present) - Game Developer

Ollie Plaatsman, founder of omni-digital technologies, has been a friend of mine since university, and we have collaborated on some little games as a hobby (hes made the music for my [homebrew wii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IwZnQj_zqE) game, we collaborated on [Awaken Alone](https://www.omnidigitaltechnologies.co.uk/awakenalone),..); As time went on, we started doing more fully fledged games.  

I'm one of the lead coders in 'Psycasso: A Disturbingly Creative Adventure', working on experimental gameplay elements of the core project. As a team lead, I write the architecture for key game systems and maintain its documentation; I consult with other devs to make sure these systems interact correctly and the development workflow remains fluid, as well as mentor when someone needs to take up tasks in a different area.
We work in Unity.    

## [Climax Studios](https://www.climaxstudios.com/) (May 2019 - April 2021) - Coder

I have taken part in several small scale codevelopment teams for AAA projects.  

I started writing multiplayer code for [Returnal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90njPwI8xNs), accomodating gameplay features for a networked environment (May 2019 - June 2020).

<br/>  

I was then moved to help [Destruction All Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNO1k5NCDOk&ab_channel=PlayStation)
achieve a standard of accessibility features expected on Sony's platform (July 2020 - October 2020).

<br/>  

Then I came back on Returnal to bring in those same accessibility standards before launch (October 2020 - April 2021), making the game more approachable for all audiences.
