## Climax Studios (May 2019 - Present) - Programmer
I have taken part in several small scale codevelopment teams, contributing
to AAA projects.  
I started writing multiplayer code for [Returnal](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Returnal), accomodating
various features for a networked environment (May 2019 - June 2020).

<br/>
I was then moved to help [Destruction All Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNO1k5NCDOk&ab_channel=PlayStation)
achieve a standard of accessibility features expected on Sony's platform (July 2020 - October 2020).

I am now back on Returnal working on a new accessibility team to bring in those same standards,
making the game more approachable for all audiences.
